Placeholder for Raspberry Pi device agent code.

## Voice Chat Test

The `src/voice_chat.py` example opens a realtime voice chat with the OpenAI
API using the system's microphone and speaker.  It injects example side
prompts at start and once every minute to steer the conversation.

Run the demo with:

```bash
python device/src/voice_chat.py
```
